SquareSolver programm. Version 1.0 22/08/2023

GENERAL USAGE NOTES
----------------------------------

-Language writing C++ (C standart).

-To compile the program, load all the source files into the compiler and press f5

-The program solves a quadratic equation for the entered coefficients. 

-If there are no solutions or some error has occurred, the program will report it. 

-The program can be run in two modes: normal_mode and testing_mode. (read more below)

-To generate documentation, use doxygen doxygen.config
===================================================================

NORMAL_MODE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- In this mode, the user receives a message from the program and enters 3 coefficients of the equation - a, b, c. 

- The program will present the number of solutions as well as their decimal representation.
===========================================================================================

TESTING_MODE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Ð•his mode provides pre-entered values in the file Tests.txt according to which the program will work. 

-After execution, the user will receive detailed information about each test and the percentage distribution of successful and unsuccessful tests.
==================================================================================================================================================

ABOUT FILLING OUT THE TEST FILE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Look at the ready-made file (Tests.txt) supplied with the program as an example.

- For each test, write down 3 coefficients separated by a space, the number of solutions in the row below and the roots in ascending order in the third row.

- After each test, you need to skip one line.

- Save the file in txt format.
